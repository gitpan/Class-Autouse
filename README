NAME
       Class::Autouse - Defer loading ( 'use'ing ) of a class
       until run time

SYNOPSIS
         use Class::Autouse;

         Class::Autouse->autouse( 'CGI' );

         print CGI->header();


DESCRIPTION
       Class::Autouse allows you to specify a class the will only
       load when a method of the class is called. For large
       classes that might not be used during the running of a
       program, such as Date::Manip, this can save you large
       amounts of memory, and decrease the script load time.
