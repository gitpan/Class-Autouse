Revision history for Perl extension Class::Autouse

1.24 Fri Jan 13 2006
	- No functional changes. No need to upgrade.
	- Updated copyright notice to 2006.
	- Added t/05_base.t to try and chase down base.pm bug
	  (Failed to find it, but left test so CPAN Tests can validate my
	  assumptions on what should happen and that it happens for them)
	- Added base.pm as a dep (although unversioned dep) to make sure
	  it is installed on older perls.
	- Module::Install updated to 0.52
	- Decrement List::Util dep to 1.17 as 1.18 fails to build on some
	  platforms.

1.23 Thu Dec 29 2005
	- In moving from CVS to SVN I forgot to bring ::Parent with it.
	  (The tests passed spuriously because it found the old version.)
	- Upgraded Module::Install and shrunk Makefile.PL again to reflect
	  the new features in it.
	- Upgraded List::Util dependency to 1.18 because of memory leaks
	  and problems with non XS versions of functions we use.

1.22 Wed Dec 21 2005
	- Apparently generating spurious warnings on Perl 5.8.1
	  on Mac OS X when using SVK. Tentatively applying solution.
	- No change in functionality on any platform.
	- No need to upgrade unless you are seeing lots of warnings.
	- Rolled back the File::Spec dependency from 0.82 to 0.80
	  to avoid needless upgrades in some 5.005 and 5.006 situations.
	- Moved from older CVS repository to newer SVN repository
	- Updated Makefile.PL to Module::Install 0.45

1.21 Wed Sep 28 2005
	- Documenting ->autouse(@classes)
	- Tidying up the POD a little to refer to features
	  in an order much more relevant to the reader.

1.20 Tue Aug 18 2005
	- Catch and rethrow all error when autoloading during a ->can.
	- Debugging can now only be done at compile time, and thus is
	  optimised out. The :debug flag is removed and instead you need
	  to preset $Class::Autouse::DEBUG.
	  Given that this was only for my benefit in the first place, it's
	  not appropriate to slow down everything else because of it.

1.18 Tue Jul 26 2005
	- Added :nostat module to disable the initial stat checks
	  of modules.

1.17 Tue Mar  8 2005
	- Added include('ExtUtils::AutoInstall') by request, to make
	  life easier when installing svk, although I have NFI why :/

1.16 Tue Feb 15 2005
	- Removing braindead pass-through Build.PL file

1.15 Wed Feb  9 2005
	- Reorganisation of method order over the last half a dozen
	  versions allowed some invalid uses of indirect object syntax
	  to slip in. This was stupid of me, and I've gotten a lot more
	  explicit in the calling of internal functions now.

1.14 Wed Jan 19 2005
	- Allowed a bug to slip in to autouse_recursive (resolved)
	- Added regression test for the case

1.13 Tue Jan 11 2005
	- Updated copyright date
	- Added no_index entry to makefile to prevent indexing A.pm etc

1.12 Mon Nov 15 2004
	- A small change to compile properly when prefork not installed

1.11 Sun Nov 14 2004

	- A few other housekeeping items

	- Integrated with prefork.pm
	- devel loads all outstanding modules when called
	- Added some more unit tests

1.04 Mon Jul  6 2004
